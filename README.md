This repository will keep track of my GO learning experience. The entire phase is divided into 4 Weeks.
It will include my personal notes as well as Documentation snippets provided by the GO Community.

## Contents 
### Week 1:
1. ####  Why GO?
  - Fast-paving compilation and execution
  - Do away with the need of working with different subsets of languages for one project.
  - A boost to code readability and documentation
  - Offering a thoroughly consistent language
  - Facilitating easy versioning of the program
  - Allowing developing with multiple languages
  - Allowing easier maintenance of dependencies
2. #### GO vs. other High Level Languages.
3. ####  Advantages of GO!
  - [x] Concurrency Support
    - Management of multiple tasks at the same time. 
    - Solves the problems in Parallelism (i.e : Conflict in Memory, Dependent tasks, When do tasks start and stop etc. )
  - [x] Garbage Collection
    - Automatic memory management. 
    - Gives a ton of control over memory allocation. 
    - Reduces latency to 1ms. Uses algorithm of Tricolor Mark & Sweep.
  - [x] Simplicity
    - Very small language specs. 
    - [Tutorials and Docs](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1)
  - [x] Scalability
    - Need of the hour with growing Applications.
    - Features such as Concurrency, Goroutines, Channels help in improving Scalability.
    
4. #### Setting up Develepment Environment.
  - [x] Download [Go Installer](https://golang.org/dl/)
  - [x] Verify GOPATH
### Week 2:
  - [x] Writing our first GoLang Program, i.e "Hello World".
